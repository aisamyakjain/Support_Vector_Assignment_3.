    "Answer: If the goal is to predict the actual price of a house as accurately as possible, the Mean Squared Error (MSE) would be a more appropriate evaluation metric compared to R-squared.\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE measures the average squared difference between the predicted and actual house prices. It provides a measure of how close the predicted prices are to the true prices, with smaller values indicating better accuracy. Minimizing the MSE helps in reducing the overall prediction errors and improving the precision of the house price predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared, on the other hand, measures the proportion of the variance in the house prices that is explained by the regression model. While R-squared is a valuable metric for understanding the goodness-of-fit and model performance, it may not directly reflect the accuracy of individual house price predictions. R-squared can be influenced by factors other than prediction accuracy, such as the variability in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, when the primary goal is to predict the actual price of a house as accurately as possible, focusing on minimizing the MSE would be more appropriate."

    "Answer: If the goal is to measure how well the SVM regression models explain the variance in the target variable, the most appropriate evaluation metric would be the coefficient of determination, also known as R-squared. R-squared provides a measure of the proportion of variance in the target variable that is explained by the model. Higher R-squared values indicate better explanatory power of the model in capturing the variance in the target variable."
